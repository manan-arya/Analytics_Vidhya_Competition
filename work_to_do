Manan I re_write the code in jupyter notebook.
beside the work done by sir , I tried 3 concepts to reduce the RMSE.
now you just go through the note book and just try some hyper parameter tuning, rest i have left comments in notebook.
NOW , after all this I want you to apply Decision tree and random forest etc.and try to reduce RMSE.
don't waste much time in xg boost , that we can see later first try all algorithm possible. 
after that , the best will be selected.
